# hFracturing - Understanding Hydraulic Fracturing Through Python!

## Motivation
While learning about hydraulic fracturing, I (most of the time) have no idea of how it works. So, now I'm trying to apply what has been written in the textbook into an animated graph of how the fracture geometry is shaped!

## Constraints
So far, I will only try to create animated graph on 2D Models, such as PKN, KGD, elliptical, and radial models. I will also use two fluid assumptions, Newtonian and Non-Newtonian.

## Upcoming Features
- [ ] PKN, KGD, elliptical, and radial model geometry
- [ ] Calculation of TSO for KGD and radial model
- [ ] Dividing between Newtonian and Non-Newtonian assumptions
- [ ] (Animated) plots!
